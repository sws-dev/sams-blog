So I have decided to take the plunge and use a static site generator to create this blog and host it on [Github pages] and so far it has been incredibly easy to set up and use. Intuitivley setting up a Jekyll site with a few key strokes in terminal and another few button presses in the Github app has made the deployment process for this incredibly easy and [jekyll-gh] even runs [Sass!].

I initially wanted to use this page for one of my sub projects [just-email.com] as I am going through a rebuild of the site and pointing the branding in a differnet direction as the client work I was using for example work had to be pulled down due to a "brand protection project" which is fair enough so I am probably going to have to rethink the marketing of these services as the work is probably too confidential to be using as marketing for other services. But as I am currently in need of a blog and wanted to start writing down my learning processes and my development journey I thought a [jekyll-gh]/[Github pages] blog would be ideal.

..And I can happily say its going well.... so far.
